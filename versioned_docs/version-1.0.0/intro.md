# Agritech

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Agritech Java Application**, a comprehensive platform designed to revolutionize the agriculture industry through technology. This application is built using Java and Spring Boot to provide farmers, agribusinesses, and stakeholders with the tools they need to manage agricultural operations more efficiently.

## About the Project

Our mission is to enhance productivity, improve sustainability, and increase profits within the agricultural sector through the use of data-driven technology. This application enables users to:

- **Monitor crop health** with real-time data and AI-powered analytics.
- **Optimize supply chain management** with tracking and reporting features.
- **Manage farming resources** (e.g., labor, equipment, water usage) efficiently.
- **Predict market trends** and optimize pricing strategies based on historical and real-time data.

## Key Features

- **Crop Management**: Track crop growth, conditions, and yields with detailed reports.
- **Farm Resource Planning**: Manage resources such as water, seeds, and fertilizers effectively.
- **Supply Chain Integration**: Real-time supply chain data, from farm to market.
- **Weather Insights**: Accurate and timely weather updates to assist in farming decisions.
- **AI-powered Analytics**: Predict crop yields, disease outbreaks, and market trends.
- **User-friendly Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards to visualize farm performance.

## High-Level Architecture

The application is built on a modern **hexagonal** architecture using **Spring Boot**. It integrates various technologies, including:

- **Spring Data JPA** for persistence management.
- **Caching** for cache management.
- **Apache Pulsar** for event-driven communication between modules.
- **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization.
- **REST APIs** for seamless integration with external systems.
